# ProgrammableImageArt
Using code to make art.

# Usage
Images are produced via ```run.txt``` files. The format of a run file is provided below
```
SIZE = (WIDTH, HEIGHT)

CODE HERE
```

In the ```run.txt``` file, you have control over the color of every pixel on the canvas of customizable size (default (1000, 1000)). As such, a lot of manipulation can be done in order to produce unique images. The color of a pixel at ```(x, y)``` is can be accessed via ```image[x, y]```. For example, if we wanted to color the point (0, 0) white, we would use the RGB value for white ```(255, 255, 255)```:
```
SIZE = (1000, 1000)
image[0, 0] = (255, 255, 255)
```
Notice that canvas ```SIZE``` is always specified first.

If we wanted to change all pixels, ```x``` and ```y``` would be used rather than actual coordinate values like in the example above. For example, if we wanted to color the entire canvas white:
```
SIZE = (1000, 1000)
image[x, y] = (255, 255, 255)
```

The ```math``` library is available for use as well. For example,
```
SIZE = (1000, 1000)
if math.dist((512, 512), (x, y)) == 100:
    image[x, y] = (255, 255, 255)
```
would produce a white circle outline with radius 100 centered at the middle of the image.

By default, all values on the canvas are ```(0, 0, 0)```; black.

To run the ```run.txt``` file, place it in the same directory as ```runfile.exe```, and run ```runfile.exe```.

As mentioned previously, the ```math``` library is available for use, alongside ```random``` and a customizable ```util```.

Specifically, If you'd like to add custom functions, write them into the ```util.py``` file. These functions can be called from ```run.txt``` using standard ```util.function()``` convention.



Many neat patterns can be generated with a few simple lines of code defining a basic rule. Below are just a few examples:
